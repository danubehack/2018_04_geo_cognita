## Summary
AI powered system to help landowners utilize their parcels based on Copernicus satellite data. Data are also used for urban planning, spatial planning and strategic planning. Raster data is classified with high precision into urban categories, different types of vegetation and its quality, and other categories. Thanks to AI we can shorten the process, otherwise few months long, to a few days time. The same process can be used in agriculture to increase productivity. The city of Bratislava was used as a model territory.
